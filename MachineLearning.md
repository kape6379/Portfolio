## Machine Learning Projects

- [Machine Learning on Texas Oil & Gas Industry Water Spills from 2013 to 2022](https://github.com/kape6379/ML5622_Final/blob/main/Machine_Learing_Final_Update.ipynb)  
  *Linear regression and random forest regression performed on data surrounding millions of gallons of wastewater spilled by oil and gas companies. Includes exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, and correlation modeling between contamination and spills through machine learning.*

- [Unsupervised Learning on Clustering Heart Disease Patient Data](https://github.com/kape6379/ML5632_Final/blob/main/Unsupervised_Learning_Final.ipynb)  
  *Hierarchical and k-means clustering to identify patient clusters in heart disease data. Includes exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, and unsupervised learning to classify similarities in patient symptoms.*

- [NLP on Coronavirus Tweets](https://github.com/kape6379/corona/blob/main/corona-2.ipynb) and [Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets](https://github.com/kape6379/NLP/blob/main/NLP.ipynb)  
  *Natural language processing projects applying tokenization, sentiment analysis, and classification methods on tweet datasets.*
