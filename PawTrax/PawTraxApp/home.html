        Some notes:
            * gap: is required only on iOS (when using UIWebView) and is needed for JS->native communication
            * https://ssl.gstatic.com is required only on Android and is needed for TalkBack to function properly
            * Disables use of inline scripts in order to mitigate risk of XSS vulnerabilities. To change this:
                * Enable inline JS: add 'unsafe-inline' to default-src
        -->

		<p>This is the homepage for PawTrax, an app that you can use to help train your dog, interact with other dogs and dog owners, along with so much more!</p>
		<p>On this page, we should probably have users log in and following that we'll display their profiles as dog owners, along with little sub-profiles for each dog that they have. This could also be the place where we let the users edit their profiles and input information about themselves and their dogs.</p>
