            <dt>Slow Feeders</dt>
            <dd>- Often times dogs of all ages and sizes get over-eager when feeding. Slow feeders help encourage pets to take it slow, and stimulate them further at a time like feeding. There are many down-sides to having a fast eating dog such as indigestion, bloat, and overall upset stomach. If your dog is a picky eater, or doesn't tend to eat well then a slow feeder will probably not be the best option for you. If you are looking into purchasing slow feeders here's a recent list of some good ones you can purchase!</dd>

            <dd>- Kids aren't the only ones who benefit from puzzles. Some fantastic stimulation for dogs' neuroligical and overall well being are dog puzzles. These puzzles often include the retrieval of treats through the form of a toy. They promote brain growth and provide for an awesome way to teach dogs considering their main way of training being strong food motivation.</dd>

            <dd>- Doggie dental hygiene is serious busieness. You can save loads on dog dental care by providing toys that stimulate dental health. If your dog is super fussy on you brushing his teeth, I'd consider checking out some of these dental toys which help them maintain their own dental health.</dd>

            <dt>Fresh Food</dt>
            <dd>- Incorporating fresh whole foods into your dogs diet can be incredibly beneficial. Trying to eliminate as much processed, and overly salted food consumption, just like you would want for yourself is desirable when thinking out for your dogs health. Incorporating some (not too many) fruits and vegetables can provide for a good supplement of enzymes and vitamins your dog otherwise wouldn't get. Also incorporating some pure protiens such as eggs and meats can be beneficial to overall health. This is a more time intensive routine so a lot of research and vet consultation is required to make sure your dog's daily nutritional values are met. </dd>

            <dt>Commercial Dog Foods</dt>
            <dd>- There is much discussion surrounding grain-free diets that come with choosing a dry dog food. Grain ingredients, though, aren't necessarily bad-- they can provide for very beneficial sustenence. When looking for a dog food, consult your vet to confirm how their diet should be broken up. Then read the food labels and look out for key features such as how much protein and fat your dog will be consuming, and how much sodium is in their food. It is important especially with dry dog food that you do not have high sodium because this will leave your dog very dehydrated. Also, another beneficial factor of dry dog food is that it also promotes dental hygiene!</dd>
