Here are some things that I'm finding out when I run the application using the command "cordova run browser" from Code/PawTraxApp

	- Every time you run the command above, cordova takes the files from www and pastes over the files in platforms/browser/www
		- For instance, this file will appear in platforms/browser/www just by doing the server start command, and any changes or new files that I add in platforms/browser/www that don't exist in www are deleted.
		- With that in mind, it looks like we need to put our code in that specific directory, at least for now.
		
	- The start page for our app, along with other properties, is in platforms/browser/www/manifest.json and they come from config.xml.
		- The other two manifest.json files (one in node_modules/cordova-browser/bin/template/www/manifest.json and other in platforms/browser/platform_www/manifest.json) don't seem to have an effect, and they don't overwrite each other, as each has its own unique application name.
		- I just noticed that the information in platforms/browser/www/manifest.json partially comes from config.xml, the base configuration file for the whole damn thing.
		
	- By the way, the application now routes to www/newIndex.html, that's something I changed in config.xml. You guys can also try it out if you want, however you want.
		- To change the styling of the front page (and all pages really), www/css/index.css is the file that contains most of the customizations that we see right now.

	- This might be troubling, but for our back-end, we may have to get creative in that we may not be able to make Express with NodeJS work for the kind of stuff we're working with (plain-jane HTML and CSS), unless we want to switch to using a server.js file and .ejs files. I don't know how that would factor in with Cordova though.
		- May have to become familiar with PHP as a way to query the database instead of some of the functionality from Express.
