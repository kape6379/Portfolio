# Paw Trax
The Paw Trax app is a web application to help dog owners track their pets’ health through activity and factors such as diet, weight, and training. 

## Features:

Utilizing tools such as Xampp and MySql we created a database storing the age, weight, and progress of individual dogs. 

* Our _home page_ includes a carousel consisting of the option to log in if not already logged in, a sign up form if you don’t already have an account, and a page to check your dogs’ progress if you are signed up. 
* Our _activity page_ consists of charted data through the form of a graph showing how much time your dog spends outside and how much distance the dog traveled. 
* Then we have the _exercise page_ which isn’t connected to the database, but is an informative resource for Paw Trax users based on their dogs age and size. 
* Similarly, the _training page_ helps users promote health through informative research and external links which are included within the page. 
* Our _explore page_ is a resource for users to access the dogs that are in the database, and when you add a dog this gets updated accordingly. 
* The _progress page_ is used to update your dogs’ weight and calculate your dogs’ average weight increase/decrease for the week based on the difference between the last two weight entries. 
* Finally, we have a _profile page_ where you can update your pets’ progress, activity and add new pets if necessary! Each feature complements the other features providing for a functional, user friendly application design.
