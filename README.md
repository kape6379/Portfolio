# Collection of Projects and Academic Exploration
*By Kate Pendavinji*

## Machine Learning  
A collection of applied machine learning projects, including supervised, unsupervised, and natural language processing methods.  
Read more about my machine learning exploration [here](https://github.com/kape6379/Portfolio/blob/main/MachineLearning.md).  

## Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD)  
Three projects showcasing my OOAD code organization and use of design patterns, including Command, State, Observer, Singleton, Strategy, Abstract Factory, Dependency Injection, REST API integration, and SQLite database design.  
See more about these projects [here](https://github.com/kape6379/Portfolio/tree/main/OOAD).  

## Robotics: Mobile Manipulation & Task Execution with Tiago Robot

Project focusing on enabling a robot to perform mobile manipulation tasks—navigating its environment, grasping objects, and executing sequences of motions. Key skills demonstrated include motion planning, perception, control systems, and robotics software integration.

## PawTrax (Software Development)  
Team based full-stack web application built to track pet health. Users can create profiles, log biometrics, and explore other dogs in the database. The repository includes our full implementation and documentation.  
Read more about this project [here](https://github.com/kape6379/Portfolio/tree/main/PawTrax).  


## Poker (Object-Oriented Analysis and Design)  
Mobile poker game built in Swift with emphasis on object-oriented programming principles (inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation). While the UI was kept simple, the design reflects solid OOP architecture.

## Human–Computer Interaction  
Designed and prototyped a COVID-era fitness and mental health app to encourage movement and social interaction. Delivered six milestones including wireframes, prototypes in Figma, and final demonstrations.
