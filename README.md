# Collections of Projects and Academic Exploration
By Kate Pendavinji

## PawTrax (Software Development)
PawTrax is a web application me and two other students completed over the summer for software development. If you navigate to the PawTrax folder you will see all of our work as well as a repo navigation in the README. The web application allows you to add a dog and update their biometrics as well as look at other dogs on the site. You can launch it by clicking the link at the bottom of the README. 

## Numerical Computation
Located in the numerical computation folder you will see another group project. It features the application of multiple different types of interpolation on topographic data using python through the CloudCompare software. If you navigate to the Project.md file within the Numerical Computation folder you will be able to see a summary of our findings. 

## Poker (Object Oriented Analysis and Design)
A group project where the main objective was to use object oriented programming. The UI does not reflect reflect our OOP concepts due to time constraints. It was completed using Swift. 

## Human Computer Interaction
This folder displays a project I completed with one other person entailing producing a prototype for an application which involves human computer interaction. Due to my classes being mostly during the pandemic, a lot of our professors made the objective to tackle COVID issues. Ours was a social workout app to help aid the lack of movement and mental health. This folder contains 6 project milestones a lot of which feature prototyping through Figma. Linked below is a one minute project overview and a prototype demonstration.

## High Performance Computing
In the high performance computing folder you will see a research project I completed surrounding how high performance is being used to arrive to renewable energy solutions. It features the skeletal outline of my two thirty minute presentations I completed as well as my journal article. 

## Bus to Show Grant Proposal
This is a piece of writing from my technical writing class which I won an award for collaborative writing through the university (PWR award). It is a grant proposal to the AARP for a local concert transportation nonprofit which was struggling to receive funding because of the pandemic.  

Thank you for taking the time to look through my work!
