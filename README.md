# Projects and Academic Exploration Collection
By Kate Pendavinji

## PawTrax
PawTrax is a web application me and two other students completed over the summer for software development. If you navigate to the PawTrax folder you will see all of our work as well as a repo navigation in the README. The web application allows you to add a dog and update their biometrics as well as look at other dogs on the site. You can launch it by clicking the link at the bottom of the README. 

## Numerical Computation
Located in the numerical computation folder you will see another group project. It features the application of multiple different types of interpolation on topographic data using python through the CloudCompare software. If you navigate to the Project.md file within the Numerical Computation folder you will be able to see a summary of our findings. 

## Poker
A group project where the objective was to use object oriented programming. This one is a little bit unfinished as we were unable to get our UI to reflect our OOP concepts in time. It was done using Swift. 

## High Performance Computing
In the high performance computing folder you will see a research project I completed surrounding how high performance is being used to arrive to renewable energy solutions. It features the skeletal outline of my two thirty minute presentations I completed as well as my journal article. 

Thank you for taking the time to look through my work!
