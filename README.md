# Collection of Projects and Academic Exploration
By Kate Pendavinji
## Machine Learning
Read more about my machine learning projects [here](https://github.com/kape6379/Portfolio/blob/main/MachineLearning.md).
## PawTrax (Software Development)
PawTrax is a web application me and two other students completed over the summer for software development. If you navigate to the PawTrax folder you will see all of our work as well as a repo navigation in the README. The web application allows you to add a dog and update their biometrics as well as look at other dogs on the site. Read more about this project [here](https://github.com/kape6379/Portfolio/tree/main/PawTrax).

## Numerical Computation
Located in the numerical computation folder you will see another group project. It features the application of multiple different types of interpolation on topographic data using python through the CloudCompare software. Read more about this project [here](https://github.com/kape6379/Portfolio/tree/main/Numerical%20Computation).

## Poker (Object Oriented Analysis and Design)
A group project where the main objective was to use object oriented programming. The UI does not reflect reflect our OOP concepts due to time constraints. It was completed using Swift. Read more about this project [here](https://github.com/kape6379/Portfolio/tree/main/Poker).

## Human Computer Interaction
This folder displays a project I completed with one other person entailing producing a prototype for an application which involves human computer interaction. Due to my classes being mostly during the pandemic, a lot of our professors made the objective to tackle COVID issues. Ours was a social workout app to help aid the lack of movement and mental health. This folder contains 6 project milestones a lot of which feature prototyping through Figma. Linked below is a one minute project overview and a prototype demonstration.

## High Performance Computing
In the high performance computing folder you will see a research project I completed surrounding how high performance is being used to arrive to renewable energy solutions. It features the skeletal outline of my two thirty minute presentations I completed as well as my journal article. Read more about this project [here](https://github.com/kape6379/Portfolio/blob/main/High%20Performance%20Computing/hpc.docx-2.pdf).

## Bus to Show Grant Proposal
This is a piece of writing from my technical writing class which was awarded for collaborative writing through The University of Colorado Boulder (PWR award). It is a grant proposal to the AARP for a local concert transportation nonprofit which was struggling to receive funding due to the pandemic.  Read more about this proposal [here](https://github.com/kape6379/Portfolio/blob/main/Bus%20to%20Show%20Grant%20Proposal/Proposal%20Group%20Project%3B%20Justin%2C%20Carson%2C%20Kate.pdf).

Thank you for taking the time to look through my work!
