# CSCI3656_Group_Project
Group project by Eben Fluto, Kai Schuyler Gonzalez, Kate Pendavinji, and Richard Terrile.
A further exploration of interpolation methods provided by scipy (https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/interpolate.html) on topographic data.

We will be performing nearest neighbors, linear, and cubic interpolation on topographic data to produce three dimensional graphs and observe package performance. Please click project.md for further information on this project.
